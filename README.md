## Description

This repository holds the changes I have made to Horiseon's HTML and CSS code. In my efforts to bring this code up to HTML accesibilty standards, I have added semantic values such as main, body, aside, etc. As for the CSS we made sure all visual attributes of this page were uniform and clean.

The outcome of these changes can be viewed on the live website link here: https://kirchnerdev22.github.io/horiseo-seo-challenge/#social-media-marketing

## Programs 

For my work on this, I used solely Virtual Studio Code.
